        "Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was born in Aachen, Germany, in 1886. He worked in his father's stone-carving shop and at several local design firms before moving to Berlin, where he joined the office of interior designer Bruno Paul. He began his architectural career as an apprentice at the studio of Peter Behrens from 1908 to 1912. Mies's early projects were traditional neoclassical homes. Seeking to establish a new architectural style that could represent modern times just as classical and Gothic did for their own eras, he joined his avant-garde peers in the search for a new architectural language."
