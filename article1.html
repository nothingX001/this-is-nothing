    <h1>The Lone Ant</h1>
    <p>While the rest of his family is having a feast,</p>
    <p>The lone ant stumbles into the house for redemption,</p>
    <p>Only rather than reaping the rewards he seeks,</p>
    <p>He finds himself on his back,</p>
    <p>on his last breathe,</p>
    <p>Stuck in the carpet right next to the A/C.</p>
    <p>No food, just death.</p>
